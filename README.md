# recipes-site

A landing page for a website with food recipes built with Sass (SCSS). Made as a practice exercise for myself so I can utilize some of the elements and skills taught in the Natours project from "Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!" on Udemy.

Under construction.
